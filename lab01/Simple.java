// Simple.java
// Print a simple message about Java.
// 
// Questions:
// 1. simple - can be used; It's a better idea to capitalize
//    the letter "s" for style and organization though.
// 2. SimpleProgram - can be used; I would recommend using this 
//    class name because it's descriptive 
// 3. 1 Simple - can't be used; you cannot start a class name
//    with a number. 
// 4. _Simple_ - can be used; I wouldn't recommend using this 
//    as it starts with an underscore. 
// 5. *Simple* - can't be used; the asterisk is not a valid
//    character for identifiers. 
// 6. $123 45 - can be used; I wouldn't use it though because
//    it doesn't mean anything to another programmer. 
// 7. Simple! - can't be used; the exclamation mark is not a 
//    valid character for identifiers.
